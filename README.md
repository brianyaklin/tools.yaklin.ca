## So whats this all about?

Hello and welcome to my site, I'm Brian Yaklin, a network engineer by day and a hobbyist web designer and blogger by night! I have been in the IT industry since around 2002 and over that period of time have come across various different tools that I use on a semi-frequent basis. In an effort to improve my frontend and backend developement knowledge I thought that I would bridge my daytime role with my hobby and make a tools site.

Part of the reason I wanted to create a tools site was to have a single location for the more common tools that I use. I'm always looking to add new tools and improve on the existing ones. If you encounter any issues with the tools or would like some features added, please feel free to create an Issue on Github for this project.
